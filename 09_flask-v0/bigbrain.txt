Q0: Flask() looks like a constructor in Java. Running Flask() creates an
instance of the default Flask app which you set to the app variable.

Q1: In files "/" usually refers to the root directory. @app.route("/") likely
routes the app to the root directory.

Q2: This wil print "__main__" into the terminal when you run app.py

Q3: "No hablo queso!" will print to the server hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Python functions in Flask will display to the web browser what they return.

Q4: In Java you call a method of a class using Class.method(), so you are calling
the instance of the Flask class to run using the run() method.

New Notes:
- The webpage at the http://127.0.0.1:5000/ URL displays the return value of the
function as expected.
- Inspecting element on the webpage shows that the python file
created html tags with "No hablo queso!" in the body tag.
- When you refresh the page, the Console shows a red
"GEThttp://127.0.0.1:5000/favicon.ico" message (404 NOT FOUND).
