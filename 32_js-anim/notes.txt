Image()
    - Creates an image
    - Does the same thing as document.createElement('img')
    - var myImage = new Image(w, h);
IMAGE_OBJ.src
    - Set this to the name of your image (a string)
CANVAS_CONTEXT.drawImage
    - Draws an image on the canvas
    - ctx.drawImage(myImage, x,y,w,h);
        - draws the image at (x,y) with a width of w and height of height
            - w and h have to be included here even if it was specified in Image()
        - (0,0) on the canvas is the upper left corner
Math.random()
    - Returns a random double in the range [0, 1)
    - Can be multiplied by factors to get higher random numbers
        - Math.random()*5 gets a random number from 0 up to 5
Math.floor(n)
    - Returns the largest int <= to n

Notes:
    - Because two separate animations were used, we need two requestIDs
    - We need to subtract the height and width of the image when we determine the maximun x and y location the image can be because the coordinates start drawing at top left of image.
