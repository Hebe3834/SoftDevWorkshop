K11 = "static" Folder 
2021-10-06

We noticed that there was a file without an extension. Upon further inspection via gedit, we noticed that it was plaintext.

We also had an html file in the static directory. As we correctly guessed, when we accessed its directory on localhost, we were served the results.


However, when we went to the directory for the plaintext file, we were promted to dowload the file. We originally thought it would throw an error as we thought it would try to find the path instead of the file.
