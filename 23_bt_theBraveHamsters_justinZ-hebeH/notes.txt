2021-12-01

DISCO(veries):
- Bootstrap containers contain content well and auto generate margins/padding nicely
- Unlike Foundation's XY grid system with cells, Bootstrap uses containers, rows, and cols
- Bootstrap has many useful form classes

Q0 
- Is there a way to align images in Bootstrap so that they are on the same line?
    - (Solved by placing images in divs, which we then arranged onto the same line)
Q1 
- We prefered Bootstrap over Foundation because it felt more organized and easy to understand.
