Questions:

How long does it take to open csv files
/is it recommended to store its information the first time we open it instead of opening it multiple times?

How does random.choices() actually work? 


Comments:

I didn't know about the random.choices() function that would have taken care of picking a random weighted occupation for us. 
Team "Nice Mice"'s solution and Team "Hi-C"'s solution both used this and were a lot more consise here.

In our solution, we made an array of weight intervals for each occupation. 
Looking at "The Best Team"'s solution and "Trio of Success"'s solution make me realize that we could have used integers 
instead of an entire array to check upper bounds, especially since we are only returning one job.

Team "Untitled" used the panda library for reading csv files. Panda is a cute name but I am still not sure how to use the library.


Concerns:

None
